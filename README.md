A curated collection of PowerShell scripts I’ve created and refined throughout my daily IT work to support **Active Directory**, **Azure AD / Entra ID**, **Exchange Online**, **Teams**, and general **Microsoft 365 administration**.

These scripts are practical tools used across multiple school environments and businesses — focusing on automation, reliability, and repeatable outcomes.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Working across multiple schools and organisations, I needed repeatable automation to:

-  Reduce time on repetitive admin tasks
-  Improve accuracy and consistency
-  Standardise onboarding and offboarding
-  Manage Teams, AD objects, and M365 resources quickly
-  Produce reliable reports for audits and troubleshooting

If these scripts save you time as well, that makes this project worthwhile.
